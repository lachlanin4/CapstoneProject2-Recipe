_instructions:
- STEP 1 - Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. To make the pastry, sift the flour into
  a large mixing bowl and add the butter or margarine. Using your fingers, mix together
  until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.
- "STEP 2 - Add about 3 tbsp cold water \u2013 1 tbsp at a time \u2013 to bind the\
  \ mixture into a ball. Then wrap it in cling film and leave to chill in the fridge\
  \ while you prepare the apples, or for 30 mins if you have time."
- STEP 3 - While the pastry is chilling, core the apples, then cut into even-sized
  chunks so they all cook in the same amount of time. Put the apples into the pie
  dish, drizzle over the honey and add the cinnamon, mixed spice and about 2 tbsp
  water.
- STEP 4 - Roll out the pastry on a floured work surface until it is large enough
  to cover the pie dish. Using the rolling pin, carefully lift the pastry and lay
  it over the top of the apple mixture. Carefully trim off the excess pastry (this
  can be rerolled and cut into shapes to decorate the pie crust if you like) and press
  the pastry edges onto the dish to create a seal.
- STEP 5 - Make a small cut in the pastry so that the air can escape during cooking,
  then brush with beaten egg to glaze.
- STEP 6 - Bake the pie in the oven for 20-30 mins until the pastry is golden and
  sandy in appearance and the apple filling is bubbling and hot.
